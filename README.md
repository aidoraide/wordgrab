You have a short time limit to build words one at a time and submit them for points. The longer the word the more points you get. Also pay attention to the multipliers in the rack as when you place a high value letter on a multiplier you can get huge amounts of points!

Unscramble:

You are given sets of scrambled letters which you have to unscramble within the time limit. If you can't unscramble a word within the time limit the game ends. Survive for as long as possible by using the purple "hint" button which places one letter in its correct place!

Grid:

Letters come down three at a time and you have two minutes to build a grid of words worth as much points as possible. Pay attention to the multipliers on the board, when combined with valuable letters they can lead to huge amounts of points. Long words give more points also!
